    <h3>my-first-website</h3>
    <p>the project uses html language and css</p>
    <p>the html helps the file to be tracked online</p>
    <h4>branching-trails-project</h4>
    <p>it uses languages such as html and css but we actually use github as the main theme</p>
    <p>through branching we are able to save code without supressing the main branch known as the master</p>
    <p>if we use a branch then we are able to code with other programmers without destroying our code</p>
    <h3>recipe</h3>
    <p>in this project i forked another persons code and copied it in github</p>
    <p>through this we are able to interact with other people codes and use them </p>
    <h4>inspiration</h4>
    <p>code is challenging but if you commit yourself to do something its easy just like babysteps </P>
    <p>the world is changing and we must look in the future and it seems humans rely mostly in technology inoder to make work easier</p>
    <h4>hobbies and skills</h4>
    <p>i love rugby and playing it because its easy to learn and fun to watch</p>
    <p>i have skills also because i play sometime</p>
