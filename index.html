     <p>the project uses html language and css</p>
     <p>the html helps the file to be tracked online</p>
     <h1>ranching-trails-project</h1>
    <p>it uses languages such as html and css but we actually use github as the main theme</p>
    <p>through branching we are able to save code without supressing the main branch known as the master</p>
    <p>if we use a branch then we are able to code with other programmers without destroying our code</p>
    <button type="button" name="submit"><h1><a href="file:///home/mophat/Documents/moringa-school-projects/recipe/index.html">Recipe</a></h1></button>
    <p>in this project i forked another persons code and copied it in github</p>
    <p>through this we are able to interact with other people codes and use them </p>
     <h1>inspiration</h1>
    <p>code is challenging but if you commit yourself to do something its easy just like babysteps </P>
    <p>the world is changing and we must look in the future and it seems humans rely mostly in technology inoder to make work easier</p>
    <h1>hobbies and skills</h1>
